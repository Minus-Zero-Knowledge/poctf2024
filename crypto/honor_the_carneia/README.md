# Crypto 300-3 - Honor the Carneia 
## Description
You ever see the movie Ghostbusters? I watched it all the time as a kid. It was one of those movies that wasn't really for children, but children ended up loving anyway. I learned a lot from those kinds of movies growing up. Maybe more than I should have known, but I've always been an inquisitive sort. Take, for example, the scene in the beginning where Dr. Venkman is testing the psychic abilities of some subjects by holding up cards with different symbols on them. He was using it to charm one of the subjects, but it got me really thinking about tests like that and the limits of our perception.

... Yeah, ok. I was an odd child.

Well, for this challenge I'm going to administer a similar test to you. A padding oracle challenge. See if you can guess the flag using your powers of inference and deduction. If you do happen to have psychic powers, now is the time to use them. Use the first link to get the encrypted flag. Use the second link to do your work. Note there's a little hitch on this one - hammer the server and you'll get a little time out.
