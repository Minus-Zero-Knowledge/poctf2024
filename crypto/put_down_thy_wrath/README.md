# Crypto 300-2 - Put Down Thy Wrath
## Description
In this challenge, you are given a public key and an encrypted message that was encrypted using a flawed implementation of homomorphic encryption. Your task is to analyze the encryption algorithm, identify its weaknesses, and use them to decrypt the message and reveal the flag. The provided file contains the encryption implementation, and here is the public key and the encrypted message. Good luck!
