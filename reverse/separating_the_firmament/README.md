# Reverse 300-1 - Separating the Firmament
## Description
I think it's time to mix things up a little bit. This time, I'm going to give you an application that will reveal the flag. All you have to do is guess the right key. Shouldn't be too hard - 22 characters, A-Z, a-z, 0-9, !-*

I know what you're thinking. "This isn't a crack challenge." I know, but I'm out of ideas for challenges and I'm phoning this one in. Just crack the stupid key. Your only other choice is to either decompile and reverse engineer the key (boring), or grab it from the running process when it validates (impossible.) Cracking passwords is way more fun (sigma gigachad move.)

MD5 checksum 139B0E82E45789C704A385726802782E

## Solution
Check Binja. The check simply compares the input with some reconstructed key. Use `gdb`, find what the input is compared with. Find key.

## Flag
`poctf{uwsp_7h3_w0rld_15_4_57463}`
