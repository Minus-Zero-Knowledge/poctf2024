# Reverse 200-3 - Constructed Languages
## Description
Here's a reverse challenge with a familiar format. A few tricks, like a redacted flag, but otherwise your objective is as you expect: Locate the flag, reverse the function that scrambled it. However, I have a confession. I did this one backwards, and if you like you can likely restore the flag manually once you figure out how it was transformed.

## Solution
Binja: hardcoded string `optc{fwups1_4__mh7_3c043}n`. Each pair of adjacent characters is swapped.

## Flag
`poctf{uwsp_1_4m_7h3_0c34n}`
