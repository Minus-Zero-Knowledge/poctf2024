# Web 100-1 - Giving Up the Game	
## Description
I can't wait to reveal this one! I have spent the entire summer working up an awesome game called Space Adventure! It's a bullet storm arcade shooter with survival horror elements and looter shooter portions heavily inspired by classics like Qubort, Donkey King, and Street Flighter II. Except this game isn't like other games - the only way to win is to cheat! Good luck!
