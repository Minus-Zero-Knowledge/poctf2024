# Misc 300-2 - Beneath the Pea Beneath the Pillow
## Description
As a kid in school we used to do something called "study hall" where you basically sat in the auditorium for an hour doing homework or whatever. I used to intentionally fail a course every year so I could test out of it within the first two weeks of the following semester and get an extra hour of study hall. Weird policy, I know, but I did it every year from middle school to the end of high school.

Well, that gave me plenty of time to sit there quietly reading or whatever, but mostly just staring off into space. The auditorium walls were brick, and I spent a lot of time just looking at them letting my imagination run wild. Eventually I devised ways to spell out secret messages using them. For example, see below. Don't forget to convert to leetspeak using the alphabet in the rules!
