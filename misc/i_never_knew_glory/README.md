# Misc 100-1 - I Never Knew Glory
## Description
A famous phrase from a famous play, \
Spoken before the Franco-fray, \
Five words that stir the English heart, \
To make the soldiers play their part.

Part one of third of Harry Five \
The very first words of kingly drive \
Dear friends, once more - you've gone too far \
Beyond Harfleur is where you are

Humble words to leet of speak \
Then claim the flag and don't be meek \
Celebrate your grasp and reach \
Of once more, dear friends, unto the breach
