# Stego 300-3 - Public Lies Private Truths
## Description
Ever see Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory? The one from 1971, I mean. If you have then you know there's a specific scene that was universally terrifying for all kids. Willy and the people get on this paddleboat and head through a tunnel. They proceed to experience a psychedelic freakout like Wonka's dosed them all with bad yellow gels while he recites/sings this bizarre tune. It's pretty tame in hindsight, but that might just be because my eyes have beheld a thousandfold horrors that would drive lesser men mad since the first time I watched it.

Anyway, for this challenge I've decided to try to reproduce that experience except on the Interweb! Visit the site below for the experience. I've also hidden my little secret here as well.

## Solution
`encode_grid.js` contains divs with varying brightness and opacities. Each (brightness, opacity) pair corresponds to a character. Use [quipqiup](https://quipqiup.com/) to solve the substitution cipher.
