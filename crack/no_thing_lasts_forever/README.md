# Crack 100-1 - No Thing Lasts Forever
## Description
Hold on... This can't be right...

My notes say this is supposed to be a "normal" crack challenge? So... I spend twelve weeks throwing these oddball cracking challenges at you, and after all that time we go back to wordlist and wait?

Kind of a jerk move, if you ask me.
