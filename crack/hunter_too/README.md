# Crack 100-3 - Hunter Too
## Description
A simple archive with the flag inside. The password is not on a common wordlist, but it can be brute-forced. That should keep you busy for a while. That's it... It's that simple.

Ok, I admit it. I'm being petty. I'm going to make you work way too hard for 100 points. I have my reasons. After five years of running the contest, I've decided to retire the crack category after this year. Every year it's the same thing. Just constant "lol pay2win" no matter how much you try to spice them up. Did you see how close I came to a nervous breakdown over the crack challenges earlier this year? Nothing I do is good enough. Throw in hints? lol pay2win. Leave a trail of breadcrumbs? lol pay2win. Literally give the answer in a cheeky sort of way? lol pay2win. Well, here's your lol pay2win challenge for the contest.

Right Click, Save As... [lol. lmao, even. rofl, one might say](https://www.pointeroverflowctf.com/static/Crack100-3.7z).
