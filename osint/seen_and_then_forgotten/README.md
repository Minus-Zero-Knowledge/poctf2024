# OSINT 100-3 - Seen and Then Forgotten
## Description
I really had to commit to pull this one off. That's right - your subject on this one is me, Prof. Johnson. However, I'd really rather not have all of you phish my dentist for my patient records and such, so I'll tell you that your trail starts on Discord and you will find the flag out on the public Internet - no stalking, social engineering, or blackmail required! That's good news for both of us! Mostly me!
