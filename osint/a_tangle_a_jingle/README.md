# OSINT 200-2 - A Tangle a Jingle
## Description
Sometimes I like to try to find the exact location where a photo was taken. A little OSINT exercise I do sometimes to keep my skills sharp. This image was posted to a social media platform last year. I was able to find where it was taken, and if you can too then you will see that there is a business just out of frame, across the street from the building on the corner, to the left of the bollards. The phone number on their sign is the password to the archive (no spaces or special characters.)

## Solution
See https://www.grimsbytelegraph.co.uk/news/grimsby-news/man-launched-unprovoked-knife-attack-8755369.

The location is: https://maps.app.goo.gl/qJ9xD2KeR46b94Xh7

The challenge description also makes reference to the following video where the location is searched for: https://youtu.be/S2Iyti7DEwk?si=64oeOVSm74ah1EWO.

This challenge can also be solved by simply cracking the archive password: **01472600874**.
