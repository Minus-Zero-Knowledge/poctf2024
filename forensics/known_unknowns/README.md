# DF 200-2 - Known Unknowns
## Description
So, I was laying in an open field with my super sensitive directional mic, trying to listen to stars like I do every Saturday night. You know, normal stuff. It was going fine and I was jamming out to the sounds of Saturn when I hear this sound coming through. I'm guessing it's the sound of swamp gas reflecting off Jupiter.
