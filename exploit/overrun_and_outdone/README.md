# Exploit 200-1 - Overrun and Outdone
## Description
Ohayoooo, Hacker-senpai!! Welcome to the ultimate kawaii exploit challenge, "Senpai's Secret Debug Mode"! It appears that Senpai has hidden some special privileges for their "super-duper admin" friends, and you must figure out how to access them! (^▽^)

But, alas, the debug mode is locked for guests, and the admin account is "totally locked, desu~!" Will you be able to find a way to bypass the restrictions and open a bash shell? You are not a super-duper admin by default, but with your 1337 skills, maybe you can convince the program otherwise! (≧ω≦)

Target IP: 35.184.182.18

Good luck, Hacker-senpai! ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶
