# Exploit 300-3 - Watchful Heavens Waiting
## Description
This exploit challenge was almost the 400-level challenge, but I swapped it out because I wasn't confident that it was accessible. I'm really curious to see how you do, and if it goes well I might be using a similar setup for my Software Exploit course!

Here's the premise: I'll provide you with a VM. I have created a user called 'ctf', password 'ctf'. And I have placed the flag in the root directory. All you need to do is get to it. To help you with that, this VM has a kernel module that has a couple problems. I've provided you with the source code (I have even notated the problematic statements for you) and Makefile, just so you can see how the sausage was made.

The module should load when you boot it up, but you can check if its running with lsmod | grep Exploit300-3

## Solution
Follow the steps on https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/268460/how-to-mount-qcow2-image to mount the hard disk of the image.
We had to use the second approach as `nbd` did not work with the file permissions.

```
sudo apt install libguestfs-tools
guestmount -a watchful_heavens.qcow2 -i --ro /tmp/watchful_heavens
```
Then simply browse to the root directory and read `flag.txt`.

## Flag
`poctf{uwsp_70_l1v3_w0uld_b3_4n_4wfully_b16_4dv3n7ur3}`
