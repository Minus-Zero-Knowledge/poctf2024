# Exploit 200-3 - Make of It What You Will
## Description
When I was first introduced to the subject of software exploits, it always amazed me how just one tiny little mistake could lead to complete disaster. Honestly, it killed any desire I might have had to become a software engineer. Luckily for me that this morbid curiosity contributed to my future career.

As a cybersecurity professional, I'd occasionally hear colleagues talk down about programmers writing spaghetti code and not understanding secure coding practices. I feel this is the wrong attitude. The truth is that anyone can make a mistake and no one can know everything.

Let's also take a moment to appreciate just how hard of a job it is to write something functional for the 200lbs hyper-primate dumbly pushing buttons on the other end. Sometimes it seems like some users will go out of their way to provide some insane edge-case input. Ask them to enter a letter? You get a number. Or space. Or ?. Or two letters. Or an order for 50 bags of concrete. Or , , or the dreaded  (apologies for the foul language.) Or 50,000 words of copypasta. Or a Ж.

Luckily we are all super-sophisticated and extra cool cybersecurity professional people, so we're way too smart for that.

Your target: 35.184.182.18 on port 32004 

## Solution
Input `%p` gives back `0x555555556037`, meaning that a format string vuln is present. In the binary, the flag is located somewhere before this address. ASLR does not seem to be turned on on the remote so we know the flag location always. It remains to construct an arbitrary read primitive. There are some issues with `sprintf` and the exclamation mark so we pad with a lot of A's so the full size parameter is used.

## Flag
`poctf{uwsp_4_r05e_by_4ny_07h3r_n4m3}`
